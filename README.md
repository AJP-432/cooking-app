# SIMPLYUM 🥗
Delta Hacks 2024 

## Introduction
What should I cook with what’s left in the fridge? What should I eat to meet my fitness goals? How can I prepare simple and nutritious meals? Our team recognizes that these are struggles that many people, especially university students, have in their everyday life.
To address this issue with modern technology, we developed a phone application which allows students to enter what they have in their fridge and generate a customized recipe tailored to their own likings. 



## Features 📚
Our application includes:
- Extraction of real time stock prices
- Calculate Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
- Compute the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to assess the stock's momentum
- Calculate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Visualize stock price trends with interactive charts
- AI Advise on investment of the stock
