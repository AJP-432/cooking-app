# SimplYum 🥗
DeltaHacks 2024 

## Introduction
What should I cook with what’s left in the fridge? What should I eat to meet my fitness goals? How can I prepare simple and nutritious meals? Our team recognizes that these are struggles that many people, especially university students, have in their everyday life.
To address this issue with modern technology, we developed a phone application which allows students to enter what they have in their fridge and generate a customized recipe tailored to their own likings. 



## Features 📚
SimplYum utilizes AI to generate customized recipes based on the ingredients, the cuisine preference, and the fitness goals the user has. Our app saves the recipes the users create, and allows them to reuse their favorite recipes. Users can also view their daily/weekly calorie and nutrition intake in the user insight page to keep track of their fitness goals. SimplYum  transforms cooking into a simple and enjoyable process, promoting healthy eating habits and a love for cooking.
